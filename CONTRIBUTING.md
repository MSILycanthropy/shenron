🐉 **Thank you so much for your support. It means the world.** 🐉

The project is very open to contributions. I am only one person, building for fun,
so it might take some time to review your contributions. Regardless, please feel free
to open any issues or PRs, I sincerely appreciate all your support!

## PR Hygiene

Contributions should pass all examples, tests and CI before merging. Please ensure there is a minimal, reproducible example [^1] to showcase the changes.

Please only mark a PR as "Ready for Review" if it is _truly_ ready for review.

## Code Style

For commit messages, please use conventional commits [^2] to make it easier to organize
release notes.
